**Kodkohoy** is an IDE-like tool designed to streamline the development of desktop applications in Raku. It provides a visual and code-based interface for building, testing, and managing UI components, especially forms and dialog boxes. Inspired by the elegance and power of the Raku language, our goal is to make GUI development fun and productive.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Form Designer:** A visual editor to drag, drop, and configure UI widgets. (Planned)
*   **Dialog Templates:** Pre-built templates for common dialogs (e.g., "Open File", "Save As", "About").
*   **Project Management:** Easily manage your project files with a built-in file explorer.
*   **Raku Code Generation:** Automatically generates the Raku source code for the UIs you design.
*   **Integrated Testing:** Tools to help you write and run tests for your UI components.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Raku application layout to keep code, assets, and documentation organized.

```
./kodkohoy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/         # Executable scripts and the main application runner
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doc/         # Project documentation, guides, and specifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image/       # UI assets, icons, logos, and other images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/         # Core Raku modules for the application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ t/           # Test files (written in Raku)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md    # This file
```

### Directory Guide

*   **`bin/`**: Contains the main executable script to launch the Kodkohoy application.
*   **`doc/`**: All supplementary documentation. This is the place for developer guides, user manuals, and architectural notes.
*   **`image/`**: Stores static image assets used by the application, such as icons for buttons or the application logo.
*   **`lib/`**: The heart of the application. All Raku modules (`.rakumod`) and classes are located here.
*   **`t/`**: The test suite. All tests should be placed here and can be run to ensure the application is working correctly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a Raku compiler installed. We recommend installing the [Rakudo Star](https://rakudo.org/downloads) bundle, which includes the compiler, the `zef` module installer, and other useful tools.

*   [Raku](https://raku.org) (v6.d or later)
*   `zef` - Raku's module installer

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/kodkohoy.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd kodkohoy
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies (if any are listed in `META6.json`):
    ```sh
    zef --deps-only install .
    ```

### Usage

To run the main Kodkohoy application, execute the script in the `bin` directory. The `-Ilib` flag tells Raku to look for modules in our `lib` directory.

```sh
raku -Ilib bin/kodkohoy
```

## üß™ Running the Tests

To run the automated tests located in the `t/` directory, use the standard Raku `prove` command:

```sh
prove -e raku -r t/
```

This will execute all files ending in `.t` within the `t` directory and report the results.
